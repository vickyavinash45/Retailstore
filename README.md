# RetailStore
I have made this program simple using a single class.
Just Run the RetailStore.java file.
User has to enter details according to the program demands.
#Discount Criteria
If the user is an employee of the store he gets 30% discount.
If the user is an affiliate of the store he gets 10% discount.
if the user is an customer of the store for 2 years he gets 5% discount.
For every $100 on the bill,there would be a $5 discount(e.g for $990,you get $45 as a discount)
Percentage based discounts doesnot apply on groceries.
User can get only one percentage discount on the bill.
